Emulator for the Chip16

For Windows users:
You will need CMake in order to create the Visual Studio solution. 
You can get it at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

How to:
1- Start CMake (cmake-gui)
2- Specify the path to the source code
3- Specify the path where you want the solution to be created. (I suggest an out-of-tree build directory)
4- Click the Configure button
7- Click the Generate button
8- The Visual Studio solution should now be in the folder you previously specified

For Linux users:
